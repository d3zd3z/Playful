Playful
#######

This repo is a small MacOS app that attempts to experiment with Swift,
Apple GUI programming, and using the SOFT/HRUF steno keyboard.  It
ultimately is my attempt to re-implement the `Plover Dojo`_ with much
better spaced repetition support.  The Dojo works well at a
superficial level, but doesn't seem to track what the user has
learned, or repeat it at any reasonable interval to learn it.
